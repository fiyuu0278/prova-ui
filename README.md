# Prova UI

This is a custom Minecraft PE UI project. The project is still in progress.

## Description

Prova UI is a fully customized UI pack for Minecraft Pocket Edition. I’m not sure if it works on Bedrock yet, but I’ll update it later.
I created this UI pack simply because I wanted to, and also because I love red lilies.
I started this project on 04-12-2025, published it on GitHub on 05-12-2025, and I’ll continue updating it as I work on it. 

## Current Status
- Initial project structure created
- Assets folders: sounds, texts, textures, ui
- Manifest and icon files added
- Added README.md
- Planning for future updates

## FAQ / Questions
**Q: Why is this taking so long?**  
A: Because I’m learning, doing school, handling other chores, and I’m going to change the whole UI—so for sure it will take time. ⏳

**Q: Will it work in Bedrock?** 
A: I’m not sure yet, but I’ll update it as soon as I test it.
